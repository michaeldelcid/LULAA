Canvas to Trello Integration
Contributors:

Team: Bruno Salgado, Michael Delcid, Jean-Carlo Delgado, Javier Diaz, (insert other names here)
Roadmap:
Refine requirements (1 week) 
Familiarization with Canvas API (1 - 2 weeks)
Develop a working backend (1-2 weeks)
Canvas has an option to output your Grades into a csv format
If we develop a script to pull these files from each chapter member, itâ€™ll be easier to parse the data from an excel sheet rather than learn the API
Output grades onto Trello, or another application (2 - 3 weeks)
Talk to jean about how he would like the the grades output
If on trello, how would he like the data organized
Requirements
App must be able to display current GPA and cumulative GPA
Functionality must be implemented to pull grades from mystevens
Or chapter members input current GPA and cumulative
App must be able to list all classes for the current semester
App must be able to grades for each class taken this semester
App must be able to pull grades periodically 
I.e pull grades weekly before chapter meetings
Minimize the amount of user interaction with app, grade pulling should be automatic cause I know damn well no one is going to spend more than 2 minutes inputting grades


Technologies 
Python most likely for rapid iterations 
Flutter if making a mobile/web application
R if outputting the data in a nice graph
