# CatT - Canvas to Trello Integration
## Contributors: Alpha Alpha Chapter of La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity Inc. 

### Team: Bruno Salgado, Michael Delcid, Jean-Carlo Delgado, Javier Diaz, (insert other names here)


### Roadmap:
1. Refine requirements (1 week) 
2. Familiarization with Canvas API (1 - 2 weeks)
3. Develop a working backend (1-2 weeks)
  i. Canvas has an option to output your Grades into a csv format
  ii. If we develop a script to pull these files from each chapter member, itâ€™ll be easier to parse the data from an excel sheet rather than learn the API
4. Output grades onto Trello, or another application (2 - 3 weeks)
  i. Talk to jean about how he would like the the grades output
  ii. If on trello, how would he like the data organized

### Requirements
1. App must be able to display current GPA and cumulative GPA
2. Functionality must be implemented to pull grades from mystevens
  i. Or chapter members input current GPA and cumulative
3. App must be able to list all classes for the current semester
4. App must be able to grades for each class taken this semester
5. App must be able to pull grades periodically 
  i. i.e. pull grades weekly before chapter meetings
6. Minimize the amount of user interaction with app, grade pulling should be automatic cause I know damn well no one is going to spend more than 2 minutes inputting grades


### Technologies 
1. Python most likely for rapid iterations 
2. Flutter if making a mobile/web application
3. R if outputting the data in a nice graph
